# Customer Call List Data Cleaning Project 
This project focuses on cleaning and processing a customer call list dataset obtained from Kaggle, utilizing Python's Pandas library. The dataset includes the following fields:

CustomerID: Unique identifier for each customer.
First_Name: Customer's first name.
Last_Name: Customer's last name.

# Key steps in the project:
Data cleaning and handling missing values.
Removal of unnecessary columns (Not_Useful_Column).
Validation of phone numbers and addresses.
Filtering records based on 'Do_Not_Contact' and 'Paying Customer' flags.
Final output provides a clean dataset ready for further analysis.
This project demonstrates the core data cleaning skills needed to prepare raw datasets for analysis.
